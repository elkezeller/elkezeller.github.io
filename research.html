<p>My research focusses on the role of vegetation in past climates, whether it be the interactions with the climate system or the impacts on human evolution. I love using various modeling and statistical techniques to see what stories the data tells us. These are my current projects:</p>

<h2 id="paleo-weather-">Paleo weather <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-sun-rain"></i></h2>

<p>Extreme weather events undeniably affect societies, yet our understanding of their behavior in high-CO<sub>2</sub> climates is still lacking. This project addresses that critical gap using paleoclimate data and advanced modeling techniques. We focus on ancient climate periods from the Pliocene to the Cretaceous. This work is part of my postdoc under the guidance of <a href="https://www.geo.arizona.edu/~jesst/" target="_blank">Jessica Tierney</a> and in collaboration with <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu" target="_blank">NCAR</a>. I focus on the interaction between paleo vegetation and climate. By studying how extreme weather events impacted vegetation and how those vegetation change feed back into the climate system, we hope to gain valuable insights that can help us make better projections for the future and improve our strategies for climate adaptation and resilience.</p>

<h2 id="climate-and-human-evolution">Climate and human evolution</h2>

<p>Climate change has significantly influenced human evolution by driving adaptations and migration patterns. As early humans encountered changes in environmental conditions, they either had to adapt to those new conditions or migrate to a more favorable location. This project explores the relationship between paleoecology/paleoclimate and human populations by combining climate modeling and statistical data analysis with archaeological data from hominin sites. My research explores the adaptability of our ancestors to shifting climates and diverse environments. This was my primary PhD research  project and is part of an ongoing collaboration with the climate and life team at <a href="https://ibsclimate.org" target="_blank">ICCP</a>.</p>

I'm a palaeoclimatologist

My research involves

I'm specialized in understanding past variability in the hydroclimate in the Southern Hemisphere semi-arid subtropics.

I currently work on speleothems from the Cradle of Humankind in South Africa and from various sites in southern Australia including the Naracoorte Caves.


I also know my way around MC-ICPMS and LA-ICPMS.



Dr. Thirumalal's research focuses on Earth's climate variability and paleoceanography. Dr.
Thirumalai uses a combination of observations, geochemical proxy measurements and modeling simulations to identify and predict the important processes in the Earth-climate system. His work involves isotopic geochemistry of carbonate archives such as corals, foraminifera, snails and stalagmites.
His current research projects focus on Indo-Pacific climate change, reconstructing Atlantic Ocean circulation anomalies, and paleomonsoon variability.


Dr. Tierney's research is called "mo-lecular paleoclimatology" because she uses fossil molecules called
"biomarkers" preserved in sediments to reconstruct past climate change. Biomarkers produced by plants and microbes and useful tools because environmental conditions like temperature and aridity are encoded in their molecular structure. Dr. Tierney utilizes organic geochemistry, stable isotopic analysis, climate model output, and statistical analysis to understand the nature of climate change and predict the effects of global warming.


My name is Rieneke Weij, and I am a Postdoctoral Scien in the Department of Geological Sciences and the Human Evolution Research Institute (HERI) at the University of Cape Town (UCT). I’m passionate about Quaternary research, particularly (U-series) geochronology, palaeoclimatology, and isotope geochemistry. I use speleothems (secondary cave carbonates) to unravel the antiquity of famous fossil cave sites and to quantify past climate change through various proxies. Together with my postdoc advisor, we are also setting up a U-Th dating capability at UCT, the first on the African continent.
